# 20Fours8
The combination of the games of 2048 and Threes. Basically, you have 1s, 3s, and 4s. As in usual Threes rules, 1 + 3 = 4. But 4 + 4 = 8, 8 + 8 = 16 and so on. Now the name is misleading, as you only have to reach the 512 tile. But this is because the hardness of the game as 1 and 1 tiles do not merge together, neither do 3 and 3 tiles. I start from a copy of 2048 in Rosetta Code. 

To play the game, clone the repository. Then go to src, then Game and do `java Game2048.java` if on linux or use something else for Windows. The benefit is that this is only a one-file system.
